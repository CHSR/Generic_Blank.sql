-- Create date: 01/08/2015
-- Description:	rspTraining_11_3_Knowledge (was 10_4) Training by 6 Months
-- EXEC rspTraining_11_3_Knowledge @progfk = 30, @sdate = '07/01/2008'
-- Edit date: 10/11/2013 CP - workerprogram was duplicating cases when worker transferred
-- Edit date: 10/11/2013 CP - the bit values in workerprogram table (FSW, FAW, Supervisor, FatherAdvocate, Program Manager)
--				are no longer being populated based on the latest workerform changes by Dar, so I've modified this report.
